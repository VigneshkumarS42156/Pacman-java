In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, interactive and engaging games play a pivotal role in both entertainment and education. Among classic arcade games, Pac-Man stands as a timeless icon, celebrated for its simple mechanics, addictive gameplay, and nostalgic charm. Modernizing such classics using current programming paradigms presents an excellent opportunity to explore the fundamentals of object-oriented design, event-driven programming, and user interface development.
This project focuses on the recreation and enhancement of the traditional Pac-Man game using Java Swing—a robust GUI toolkit for Java. In addition to recreating the core gameplay, this implementation introduces new components such as player registration forms, score tracking, level progression. The project is designed not only to offer an immersive gaming experience but also to serve as an educational example of integrating graphical design with backend data management.
